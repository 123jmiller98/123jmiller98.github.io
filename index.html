                Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. This website is a collection of some of the coding projects I have completed. Details for each project in several differing programming languages can be found by clicking on the navigation links at the top of the page, or on the video titles on the home page. Demonstration videos of the projects in action, as well as a slideshow and description of each project are also available for your convenience. The source code is available for viewing in browser as well as to download. Executable versions of these programs are available where relevant. Each one of these projects has been written solely by me, and demonstrate my understanding and abilities in each of the individual languages. The projects are:
                <h2> <a href="pages/javaExample.html">Java Project – Check Deposit Database </a> </h2>
                This is a project I wrote as a final for my CSIS 222 OOP with Java course. This program allows a user to save, edit,  and view checks in a database. This program uses Java integrated with SQL to store and edit the data.
                <h2> <a href="pages/cppExample.html"> C++ project – Operator Overload Demo </a> </h2>
                This program is a demonstration in C++ of object operator overloading as well as object inheritence. 

                <h2> <a href="pages/pythonExample.html">Python project – Falling Asteroids </a></h2>
                This program is a game inspired by the classic game "Space Invaders". I completed this project for my scripting course final. 

                <h2> <a href="pages/htmlExample.html"> HTML, CSS, JavaScript – This Website</a></h2>
                This website demonstrates my abilities in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Source code is available for viewing.

                <h2> <a href="pages/csgoExample.html"> CSGO MAP – Hargrove’s Pattern Repair</a></h2>
                This is a wingman map for the video game Counter-Strike: Global offensive. It was created in the Source SDK framework. The video trailer for this map was shot and edited by me.
